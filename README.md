# TypingSpeedTest
This project aims to develop a typing speed test application in Java to assess users' typing proficiency. The primary objective is to measure typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy by displaying random text for users to type within a set time limit. The methodology involves implementing an interface for user interaction, alongside logic for tracking time, calculating speed, and evaluating accuracy. Key findings include providing real-time feedback and storing test results for future reference. The project concludes with a functional tool for users to track and improve their typing skills over time.
